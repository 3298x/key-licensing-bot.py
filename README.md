The bot uses requests to communicate with the api.
You'll need to replace the keys, and ID's at the top of the file to make it function.

Once you got everything set up, just type "/" and select the bot's command create keys.
Below is an example of how to use the command.
```/createkey period: 10 max_no_of_machines: 1 no_of_keys: 1```
Period is the number of days the key is active for. Set to 100k for lifetime.
Max_no_of_machines is Hwid Lock. 0=no 1=yes
No_of_keys is pretty self explanatory.
