# Cryptolens Key Licensing Bot

The bot uses requests to communicate with the api.

You'll need to replace the keys, and ID's at the top of the file to make it function.


**1.** Create account here:
[cryptolens website]([url](https://app.cryptolens.io))

**2.** Get product id, and api token
   
**3.** get discord bot token and allowed role id
   
**4.** Put all into code (comments with instructions)



Once you got everything set up, just type "/" and select the bot's command create keys.

Below is an example of how to use the command.

```/createkey period: 10 max_no_of_machines: 1 no_of_keys: 1```

Period is the number of days the key is active for. Set to 100k for lifetime.

Max_no_of_machines is Hwid Lock. 0=no 1=yes

No_of_keys is pretty self explanatory.
